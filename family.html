<li>  This is my beloved family, and we captured this memorable family photo during the joyous celebration of Raya Aidilfitri 2024. Plus, this is our first time celebrating Raya Aidilfitri together. </li>
</br> 

<br> 
  <li> This family of mine is not perfect, of course. There are occasional disagreements and tough times, but the bond we share is unbreakable. Together, we celebrate joys, weather storms, and grow stronger every day. </li>
</br>

<br>
  <li> And my family’s story? It’s a mix of triumphs, lessons, and dreams—woven with threads of shared experiences and cherished memories. They’re not just people I live with; they’re my safe haven, my constant, and your most greatest blessing</li>
</ul>
